BenVele's Office 365 Management Tool

This is a custom Office 365 management app written in Java.
It is based off of my experience working in an MSP and the shortcomings of the Office 365 online Admin portals.
This is to help those who do not feel comfortable using the Office 365 powershell management tools and 
includes powershell scripts to more easily manage your Office 365 environment.

In the future I hope to build this into a web app as well as a zero-trust, multi-tenant tool to be used in MSPs 
and other service providers.
